# Pandemic! Control a Pandemic Disease before it Runs Rampant

  _Presented at:_ [Supercomputing22](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=misc102&sess=sess302)
  <br><br>
  Experience a slice of the computational research world, take the role of a computational scientist tasked with understanding 
  a pandemic currently spreading through a community and researching solutions to keep the community safe.
  <br><br>
  The SC22 Student Programming will host a workshop that will introduce students to a slice of that computational research cycle. 
  The workshop will be taught by Charlie Dey and Jeâ€™aime Powell from the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).
  <br><br>
  Computational research begins with an observation of a natural occurrence, then transitions to developing a model which 
  mathematically describes that occurrence, to using advanced computing techniques to solve that model, then generating, 
  verifying, and validating the data against observational data, and repeating the cycle: building and expanding, solving, 
  generating, verifying and validating. The end goal is to build a system, accurately representing a scientific process, 
  which you can run "what if" scenarios against when a real world experiment is not attainable.
  <br><br>
  It starts with a simple scientific process, using simple probability to get a "person" sick. Then expand that simple process 
  into a computational model to simulate a disease propagating through a set population. Students will be broken into teams 
  and given a set of challenges, requiring the teams to update and expand their computational models to meet.
